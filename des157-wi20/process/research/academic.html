            <p>The planet Earth is suffering from what we called the “Environmental Crisis” which is a dramatic change and worsening of the environment resulting in major environmental issues such as climate change, pollution, resource depletion and the greenhouse effect or global warming.  Unfortunately, these major current issues have something to do with many of humanity’s unsustainable practices such as deforestation and disposal of plastic wastes in the ocean.  Many leaders had stood up and created environmental movements to alarm people and increased their awareness about the current state of the planet Earth. But despite the increased awareness, many still continue to live with an unsustainable lifestyle and even make it worse. Some people may think that it is the scientists and the government’s responsibilities to solve it and that it is not that big a deal to be concerned about and panic. But even though the government is trying to implement an environmental policy and scientists are trying to do their best to find solutions, they can’t solve it alone. As Naznin Islam points out from the article “Public Awareness About Environmental Issues: Perspective Bangladesh,”  the lack of citizen’s response is the cause of failure despite some environmental movements and policies proposed by the government and the level of understanding awareness and participation in Bangladesh is low. Though her research is based on Bangladesh's perspective, Bangladesh is just one of the many countries that faces environmental degradation (Islam 31). It shows that people are unaware of the environmental crisis and what’s at stake. As Paul K. Doss points out in his Ted Talk video, Beyond the Science: Environmental Problems...Cultural Solutions, Science may provide us the power and knowledge to understand our environment however they can’t solve environmental problems and measurable threats from global climate change alone if many people are not willing to cooperate on taking actions towards saving our environment. He said that the best solution to the major current issues is cultural behavioral change.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>My project is a screen based interactive project that intends to increase the awareness on environmental issues and shares simple solutions and strategies that people can do towards saving the environment. It will focus more on living with low impact activities and simple changes in our lifestyle like biking, composting or using less water and energy consumption or living a zero waste life, which means waste prevention or recycling goal. It is better if we live with no plastics at all because it impacts the environment negatively. Implementing these actions may be small but can make a big difference to the environment. According to Lauren Singer in her Tedx Talks video, “Why I live a zero waste life,” “One simple idea can change everything” (“Why I Live a Zero Waste Life | Lauren Singer | TEDxTeen” 03:15–05:21). There are a lot of ideas to help nature and to live sustainably. We should do these actions seriously and consistently. We need to help and act now before it’s too late even if our actions are small. We have to be reminded that Earth is our habitat. Like us humans, Earth has only one life, if we don’t nurture it well, we will lose our beloved planet Earth and we also might lose the whole humanity.</p>
