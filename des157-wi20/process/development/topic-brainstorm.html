                <p>Affinity Mapping is a great start of brainstoming session especially with organizing large number of ideas into their natural relationships. The first step I did is analyzing the problem. Since we already did Affinity Mapping in class, it easy for me to figure out the problems and some ideas. We were given five categories mainly issues, tech system, inclusiveness, value/community and social behavior. I read all the ideas provided and tried to narrow it down according to their designated categories. I eliminated some ideas that has the same meaning. Then I sketch it to the way I can easily understand the mapping as shown above</p>
