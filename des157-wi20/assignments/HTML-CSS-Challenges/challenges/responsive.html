                <h2>About Media Queries</h2>
                <p>Media queries is applied to display web pages on different devices in a more easy and convenient way. It is brought by responsive web design. With media queries, user can access websites on desktop, tablet and mobile devices. Media queries work in stylesheet by specifying the elements with certain conditions.</p>
                <p>There are different types of queries used for styling but the most important is by using max-width and min-width media query. Max-width can only be applied if the screen or the viewing area size is smaller than 300px while min-width can be applied if the screen is larger than 600px. It is actually helpful and common to combine these two media queries together as it provides more accuracy on the webpages.</p>
                <p>It is helpful to adopt the strategic approach of mobile-first and responsive then desktop development later in designing or styling web pages. The reason is because the page display will go faster on smaller devices plus a lot of people use mobile devices than desktop these days.</p>

                <h2>Relative Units</h2>
                <p>The units in length used in CSS stylesheet can be either absolute or relative units. Absolute consists of pixels, points and so on while relative units include the use of percentages, em, ex and so on. Focusing on the definition of relative units, it is used to specify a length relative to an element’s parent object.</p>
                <p>As mentioned above, percentage is an example of a relative unit to properties such as image, margin, padding, height and width. The element “em” is also an example which is used for font sizes. Another example of relative units is “vw” and “vh.” The unit “vw” stands for viewport width while vh stands for viewport height. The main difference of using relative units of “vw” and “vh” instead of percentage is percentage tends to make an element occupies space available in the screen while “vw” and “vh” has a specific measure.</p>

                <h2>Meta Viewport Tag</h2>
                <p>Meta viewport tag is necessary and must be put to the top of the webpage because it keeps the measurements consistent when accessed on different medias specifically mobile devices. </p>
                <p>After viewing my webpage with meta viewport, I can now resize my webpage and its contents without squeezing or stretching the font and the content box even the images. The web design is responsive to any screen size.</p>
