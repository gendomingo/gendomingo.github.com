                <h2>Structure, Phrasing and Display</h2>
                <p>Display is a property in CSS which controls the layout of the page. Display has two default elements, block and inline elements, which are both classified as two main categories for HTML for the purpose of styling the webpage. The main difference is a block element can be stretched from left to right, it takes up the full width of a page. It always starts on a new line and has a line break. Example of a block elements include heading tags, list tags and even div element. On the other hand, inline element all contrasts to block element, it only takes up as much width as it needs and does not have a line break. Examples of inline elements include anchor, emphasis and image tags. Aside from block and inline elements in display property, none is also used as a default setting. It is commonly used with JavaScript which hides and show an element without deleting them. Other settings include visibility and hidden visibility.</p>

                <h2>Box Model</h2>
                <p>CSS box model is a container which includes margin, border, padding and the actual content. It is like a tool kit that helps to customize, design and adjust dimensions of the box in the layout scheme. It is a set of rules to help organize layout when styling a webpage. Applying box-sizing CSS property affects the total width and height of the whole box in the screen.</p>

                <h2>Background Images</h2>
                <p>The use of image in the page and as CSS background has different purposes. Image in the page is applied when it is part of the content while image as CSS background is for styling purposes. But in terms of coding, the use of CSS background image is easier than coding image in the page.</p>
